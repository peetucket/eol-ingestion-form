#Fill here the uBio keys for your application
#In this sample:
#For development and test, we have only one possible host (localhost:3000), so there is only a single key associated with the mode.
#In production, the app can be accessed through 2 different hosts: example1.com and exaaple2.com. There then needs a 2-key hash. If you deployed to one host, only the API key would be needed (as in development and test).
